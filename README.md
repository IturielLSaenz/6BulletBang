# 6BulletBang
6BulletBang is a terminal based game im developing to understand better the workflow and methods of c++. There's still work to do on the game logic but so far im satisfied with the progress.

The next thing to implement is the basic game logic, turn based and changes. The economy system, as well of all calculations that involves betting your balance. And finally, terminal window and remote access for multiplayer.

This will be a really exciting project to become better at c++ little by little.

Thank you!
